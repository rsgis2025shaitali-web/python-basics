        "(c) Aerosols are a critical component of the Earth's atmosphere, acting as the primary lever for both cooling the planet and influencing human health. They affect radiation directly by scattering sunlight back into space (cooling) or absorbing it (warming, as in the case of black carbon), and indirectly by increasing cloud reflectivity. As \"seeds\" for cloud formation, aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN); an increase in aerosols typically leads to more numerous but smaller droplets, which can brighten clouds and suppress initial precipitation. Finally, aerosols are a major driver of poor air quality, with fine particulate matter ($PM_{2.5}$) capable of penetrating deep into the lungs and bloodstream, leading to millions of premature deaths annually from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases."
